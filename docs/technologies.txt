the technologies to consider:

a.python: anaconda framework - https://www.continuum.io/downloads (python 3.6)

b.neo4j - https://neo4j.com/download/ (community edition)

c. neo4j python drivers - 
https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/3.2/drivers/get-started/
(*) https://pypi.python.org/pypi/neo4j-driver

I used Bolt drivers, often is also cited the http://py2neo.org/2.0/,
but this last is not updated with the new versions of neo4j, so please consider the Bolt driver (*)

d.flask web application framework - http://flask.pocoo.org/

---create a demo of the architecture:
